# Handoff — the mailbox

> **Class:** log · **Status:** frozen · **Reviewed:** 2026-10-03

**Read this first, before any other file, every time you start work here.** More than
one agent works in this repo and nothing signals a switch. This file is how the
previous one tells you what it did and what it broke.

Two slots. **Overwrite your own; never edit the other agent's.** Keep each slot under
~25 lines — this is a mailbox, not an archive. The archive is
[handoff_synopsis.md](handoff_synopsis.md) (session state) and
[planning_log.md](planning_log.md) (why, append-only).

## Verify before you trust it

Prose goes stale; git does not. Every slot records the HEAD it was written at, so you
can check the claim instead of believing it:

```bash
git log <sha-from-the-slot>..HEAD --oneline
git status --short
```

**A slot several commits behind HEAD is normal** - the second agent helps intermittently,
so being behind is expected, not a defect. What matters is whether its claims match git.

If the slot says "committed" and `git log` shows nothing, the work is sitting
uncommitted in your tree — that has happened four times. If `git status` shows files
the slot never mentions, the other agent is **still working right now**: re-read any
file immediately before you edit it, and never `git checkout` a file to discard changes
you did not make.

Both agents commit as the same git author, so **sign your commits** —
`Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>` or
`Co-authored-by: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`. The trailer says *who*; the SHA anchor
above says *what has happened since*. You need both. (The hook used to reject these;
the operator lifted that ban on 2026-08-28.)

One command reads all of it — signed split, uncommitted count, and whether each slot is
behind HEAD:

```bash
py -m scripts.ops agents
```

## Write your slot before you stop

Not after the last edit — *as* the last edit. A slot written from memory next session
is the thing this file exists to replace. State defects before wins; if you found
nothing broken, say that explicitly rather than leaving it implied.

## Slot — Claude Code

**Written:** 2026-10-05 · **HEAD at write:** `f3929ae` (#961) + the wave 58 commit (`git log -1`)
· **Tree:** clean after the commit.

**Read before editing:** who's who is `core/facts/entity_lookup` (Wikidata + Wikipedia, keyless,
`entity_research` signal: "Reference data" lines at signal tier, "Reference text" at web tier).
Settled/fresh is `core/facts/freshness` (`features.research`), read by the facts prompt
(`core/ui._research_verdict`) and `ops batch-review`. `tests/__init__.py` pins every research flag
off - a live script that imports `tests` must turn them back on. `content_tokens` folds accents
now (`fold_accents`). The verifier's `weak_lines` = brief-tier lines. mypy **121**.

**Defects first:**
- The script could state a team or title from memory, and a brief written from memory counted as
  support (#966); "Pokémon" tokenized as "pok" + "mon" (fixed); `search_query` still splits
  "Ghost of Yotei" at "of" for every signal (#969, needs a replay check).
- No real Wikidata/Wikipedia/Google News call was made here (proxy) - the operator's run is the proof.

**Shipped:** #963 #964 #965 #966 #967 (+ accent folding). Suite **4,570**, 0 network attempts,
`data/` clean; corpus 85; backlog **240 numbered open**, highest #969. Phase M is Buffer now:
next **#968 ops crosspost · #962 · #958 · #957 · #49**; #952's direct APIs parked.

## Slot — Cursor

**Written:** 2026-09-20 · **HEAD at write:** `096c13b` · **Tree:** footage intake only;
do not commit Claude's uncommitted calibration/clip-band files.

**Defects first:**
- **`footage-add` still overwrites the folder `license` string.** Fortnite (32 owned)
  and Marvel Rivals (16 owned) would have been labelled third-party. Mixed yaml
  rewritten after import (GTA V pattern). Same footgun on the next mixed folder.
- **Pinned `yt-dlp==2026.6.9` 403s YouTube DASH.** Probe worked; download needed a
  temp 2026.8.19 extractor. Pin unchanged.
- **Twitch, Football, AI still empty.** This batch did not fill them.

**Intake (7/7 gameplay, muted 1080p H.264, not committed):**
Forza Horizon 5 `flUiLwMaiOU` CC-BY; Fortnite `Am18G4IDNnM` CC-BY mixed;
Steep `EnGiQrWBrko` CC-BY; Mario Kart 8 `npz4T7sznog` title-claims reuse;
CSGO `QnA_YwbRZ2k`+`OikR-0gh8QE` title-claims reuse; Marvel Rivals
`stsnPWyDSLE` CC-BY mixed. `ops footage --channel tapin`: Marvel Rivals 17,
Fortnite 33 on disk. New folders are umbrella-only.

**Operator paste:**
```
Footage per playlist niche ...
  Marvel Rivals    Marvel Rivals (17 clips, ...)
  Twitch           NO FOOTAGE
  Football         NO FOOTAGE
  AI Development   NO FOOTAGE
```
