## Last wave — 2026-10-23 late (Claude Code): wave 126, a phantom slot first

A held run's job held Sat noon, the slot run 184's UFC 333 preview needed before the card - a
job now reserves a slot only when it can go public there; the pass line counts tries. With the
operator's yes run 175 is set for Sun 10 PM EDT and the hook rewrite is an experiment (on/off by
draft). Hook variants rank by the measured traits once a channel has them; thumbnails.set's
answer confirms the image; `roadmap-index` gives the idea-expiry date and open items per public
video.

## Previous — 2026-10-23 night (Claude Code): wave 125, UFC 333 first

After the operator's sign-in and review: run 184, a UFC 333 preview, was queued for the day after
the card - a card named by number now finds its event, and the worker moves a job past its event
before it uploads; with the operator's yes run 180 goes public Fri 10:45 PM EDT and run 179 (last
season's seed) is off the schedule (`ops unschedule`). Captions wait for queued uploads, the
weak-hook hold is lifted, the hook rewrite writes calls again (it had adopted nothing on 17 of 18
runs), ten best-held openers in its prompt, one of three hooks at review, a render per process,
`ops shortfalls` weekly.

## Previous — 2026-10-23 evening (Claude Code): wave 124, the next ten

Two defects first: run 181, a Cavaliers-76ers preview, was still queued a day after its tip-off
and nothing would have stopped it uploading - the worker, the shelf and go-public now read the
game (#1547); run 176, the UFC 333 preview, read "past its window" the day before the card (#1548).
With the operator's calls: the hook score out of the grade and overnight's order (decision 70)
and a run at power-on is normal, no Sleep ask (decision 69). Then `ops hooks` (each opener trait;
longer openers held more), why a curve is missing, the GPU driver in the doctor, and the backlog
by shortfall. Open 180.

## Pipeline order (operator)

```
Topic → Discovery (signals + editorial ANGLES) → pick angle → length → KEY FACTS → [fact conflicts] → script → TITLE → grounding → [trade check] → tier warnings → claim verifier → authenticity → [thin facts / event not in facts] → report card → render → [vault dossier]
```

**Titles are NOT chosen at discovery.** Discovery returns short angle lines; `core/title_generator.py` writes the YouTube title after key facts + script + grounding.

**Vault mirror (Pillar 4):** when `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` is set, every drafted/rendered run writes `{channel}/_runs/{run_id}_{slug}.md` (layout: [vault.md](vault.md)); `daily_sync` / `ops vault-sync` refresh dossiers with post-sync actuals. Strategy notes feed a bounded `CHANNEL PLAYBOOK` block in the script prompt (style, not facts).

## Key facts (operator ground truth)

| Feature | Where |
|---------|--------|
| Multi-line paste | Type `paste` at key-facts prompt |
| Vault save (all facts) | typed lines -> `vault/<channel>/_operator_facts/` (`tier: operator`); pasted-link lines -> `_link_facts/` (`tier: link`, since run 98) |
| LLM packing | Char budget 12000 (`OPERATOR_KEY_FACT_CHAR_BUDGET`), line cap 150 (`MAX_OPERATOR_KEY_FACTS`); only lines typed this run pin |
| Priority | typed → links → vault; pasted-link lines with no contact with the angle are listed first (Enter drops, `k` keeps) |
| Conflicts | Operator facts win — contradicting signal/web lines dropped pre-prompt (`FACT_CONFLICT_FILTER`) |
| Playbook | Strategy/belief notes → `CHANNEL PLAYBOOK` prompt block (NOT facts) |
| Run dossiers | `vault/<channel>/_runs/` — records of what we made, never read back as facts |
| Link scrape | Yahoo/list items OK; ESPN WAF → use `paste`; Bing search/captcha blocked; `ck/a` unwraps |
| Sports on TapIn | domain from the topic (`infer_topic_domain`); football is TapIn's (`soccer`, §34); NBA/NFL/UFC/soccer matrices; pasted sport facts still override |
| **Headless** | `auto_generate --facts-file <paste-block.txt> --fact "..."` (repeatable) |

## Credit / speed

- **O1–O11 backlog complete** ([credit_efficiency.md](credit_efficiency.md)). `core/quota_governor.py`
  is the single façade over `data/quota_state.json`: Apify exhaustion + usage cache, LLM daily
  spend, persisted signal disables (key-hash invalidated), `snapshot()` for the dashboard.
- Apify 403 = auth (30m TTL), 402 = credits — persists until the real monthly cycle reset
  (`core/reset_window.py`, `APIFY_RESET_DAY`, O10)
- `SIGNAL_BACKEND=apify|free|auto` — `free`/`auto` serve `youtube_competitors` via yt-dlp and
  `reddit` via official OAuth (free script app) at $0; Twitter/TikTok stay Apify
- The claim verifier adds **one extract-tier LLM call per script** (free-first chain, §14);
  `CLAIM_VERIFIER_ENABLED=false` opts out
- Vault reads are **mtime-cached in-process** (`core/vault_index.py`) — no extra cost, big win
  for `batch-drafts` (N ideas × `load_facts` per run)
- `py -m scripts.ops reliability` — dashboard (breakers, budgets, persisted disables, resets, cache)

## Best 5 terminal commands (outside `py main.py`)

1. `py -m scripts.ops daily-brief` — morning one-shot: fresh data → ideas → quota → queue
2. `py -m scripts.ops traces` / `ops dossier --run-id N` — run ledger viewers
3. `py -m scripts.ops vault-sync --channel tapin` — beliefs + dossier refresh into vault
4. `py -m scripts.ops batch-drafts --channel tapin --count 3` — unattended draft scripts (feeds A/B)
5. `py -m scripts.ops reliability` — credit/quota/breaker/cache dashboard
6. `py -m scripts.ops feeds` — RSS source health (ok/stale/dead); run monthly, feeds die quietly

Setup path (fresh machine): `py -m scripts.ops all-setup --channel tapin`.

## Open (roadmap next)

The live list is [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) "Recommended next five"; this is the standing context.

1. **Operator:** `git pull`, `pip install -e ".[app]"`; in ElevenLabs lower Stability (~35-45) and raise Style (~20-30) on the TapIn voices; rerun the Chargers idea (Enter on angle 1), then try "M" on the angle screen; record Madden / UFC 5 gameplay (`ops footage-add`) - stock is now a last resort; confirm runs 119 and 120's claims with `ops verify-claim --run-id N` (run 119's chapter line: Studio by hand), then `go-public`; hand Cursor `docs/cursor_brief_2026-10.md`; `ops spend add` for what was paid; `CONTENT_CHANNEL_ID=tapin` and `youtube.oauth_setup --channel tapin` if not done; Buffer for TikTok and Instagram (#968); the Reporting API (#951); `ops backfill all --apply` if `ops backfill` agrees.
2. **Product next (by epic, backlog.md "Epics"):** #849 fact-fit waits on 5+ measured runs (E1)
   · #863's call prints itself at ten runs (E3).
3. **Structural:** #914 emoji font off Windows · #459 dead code (operator call) · #975 the organic rate on a real boosted video.
   Any live-run defect: add a corpus case.
4. **App:** #860 facts room shipped wave 46; next Stage 3 panel per [desktop_app.md](desktop_app.md).
5. **Operator calls, standing:** `positioning.md` still pitches a micro-SaaS surface, which
   contradicts the private-tool constraint in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) - the charter is yours
   to rewrite or archive. One OAuth consent then `ops playlists --apply`; gameplay files for
   the empty niches (#786); remote branch deletions this environment cannot do.

**Next:** #1361 #1364 #1367 #1541 #1409 (roadmap.md). **Ads:** November gets one $20 test (decision 74, 10-24) - enter it with `ops spend add --kind ads`. **Parked / excluded:** Benable bot · Edge TTS as default (§28). #1255 and #1247 are open and not next.

## Docs to read first

- `docs/decisions.md` §15 (pillar reorientation), §16 (Fact Engine), **§17b (vault OS)**, **§34 (topic domain, football, link tier, v5)**
- `docs/vault.md` — the vault end to end
- `docs/master_plan.md` — the forward plan, with the sample schedule in M4
- `docs/credit_efficiency.md` — O1–O11 (all ✅)
- `docs/roadmap.md` — Pillars 1–7 ✅ (Pillar 6 backends parked on CUDA torch); post-wave-4 pickup shipped
- `docs/providers_runbook.md` — Pillar 6 tool → module → env → proof index
- `docs/debugging.md` — playbook vs facts, hallucination triage
