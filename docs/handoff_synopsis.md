## Last wave — 2026-10-01 (Claude Code): wave 51 #921 #579 #575 #588 #567 + run 109's #922-#926

- **Run 109 fixes:** the discovery Headroom line now shows YouTube units (#922); the projected
  cost includes the thumbnail (#923); a long title ends at a clause, not "...under Neil…" (#924);
  a headline needs a distinctive topic word, not "game" (#925); "surging competitor" needs a
  recent video well ahead of the rest (#926).
- **#921** the suite cannot reach the network: a test that tries fails, naming host, frame and
  thread. Seven offenders stubbed; ~38 s per run.
- **#579** the Proceed? report sets the cost against what the channel's RPM says the video earns.
- **#575 / #588** `ops signal-audit`: runs / active / fed / cited per signal, retirement
  candidates (your call), and frozen payloads; `ops reliability` names a frozen signal.
- **#567** the post-time experiment flips a seeded coin; off-slot videos go to a random hour
  within +/-`POST_TIME_WINDOW_HOURS` (3). Still opt-in.

**Verify:** `python -m unittest tests.test_run109_defects tests.test_network_guard
tests.test_cost_vs_return tests.test_signal_audit tests.test_post_time_random`;
`py -m scripts.ops signal-audit`; `py -m scripts.ops economics`.

## Previous — 2026-09-30 (Claude Code): wave 50 #920 #566 #565 #428 #578

- **#920** every synced / seeded row says which measure its engaged rate is (`engaged_basis`);
  likes/views no longer counts; `ops predictions` shows the mix.
- **#566** `ops title-patterns` ranks by lift over the channel (shrunk); "proven" needs +1pp.
- **#428** `ops tag-report`: tags and #hashtags by lift; tags on every video named, not ranked.
- **#565** `ops retention-diff [--run-id A B]`: two curves side by side, where the gap opened.
- **#578** the economics summary prints cost per finished minute.

**Verify:** `python -m unittest tests.test_engaged_basis tests.test_title_lift
tests.test_tag_performance tests.test_retention_diff tests.test_cost_per_minute`;
`py -m scripts.ops tag-report`; `py -m scripts.ops retention-diff`.

## Previous — 2026-09-30 (Claude Code): wave 49 #918 #598 #564 #919 #917

- **#918** the metrics sync pulls every live video younger than `SYNC_YOUNG_DAYS` (8), then the
  newest few - first-day snapshots and views by day stop being missed.
- **#598** `ops weekly-report` has a "By upload_mode" block: scheduled vs immediate, with actions.
- **#564** `MIN_OUTCOME_VIEWS` (off): videos under it stop teaching every recommender;
  `ops predictions` says how many sit under 50 views. YouTube cannot separate your own views.
- **#919** a script, a thumbnail and a post-time experiment run together;
  `py -m core.experiments stop post_time` stops one.
- **#917** a fact conflict names the signal section that lost; `ops source-trust` counts them.

**Verify:** `python -m unittest tests.test_sync_young_videos tests.test_upload_mode_report
tests.test_view_floor tests.test_experiments_per_kind tests.test_conflict_sections`;
`py -m scripts.ops weekly-report`; `py -m scripts.ops predictions`.

## Pipeline order (operator)

```
Topic → Discovery (signals + editorial ANGLES) → pick angle → length → KEY FACTS → [fact conflicts] → script → TITLE → grounding → [trade check] → tier warnings → claim verifier → authenticity → [thin facts / event not in facts] → report card → render → [vault dossier]
```

**Titles are NOT chosen at discovery.** Discovery returns short angle lines; `core/title_generator.py` writes the YouTube title after key facts + script + grounding.

**Vault mirror (Pillar 4):** when `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` is set, every drafted/rendered run writes `{channel}/_runs/{run_id}_{slug}.md` (layout: [vault.md](vault.md)); `daily_sync` / `ops vault-sync` refresh dossiers with post-sync actuals. Strategy notes feed a bounded `CHANNEL PLAYBOOK` block in the script prompt (style, not facts).

## Key facts (operator ground truth)

| Feature | Where |
|---------|--------|
| Multi-line paste | Type `paste` at key-facts prompt |
| Vault save (all facts) | typed lines -> `vault/<channel>/_operator_facts/` (`tier: operator`); pasted-link lines -> `_link_facts/` (`tier: link`, since run 98) |
| LLM packing | Char budget 12000 (`OPERATOR_KEY_FACT_CHAR_BUDGET`), line cap 150 (`MAX_OPERATOR_KEY_FACTS`); only lines typed this run pin |
| Priority | typed → links → vault; pasted-link lines with no contact with the angle are listed first (Enter drops, `k` keeps) |
| Conflicts | Operator facts win — contradicting signal/web lines dropped pre-prompt (`FACT_CONFLICT_FILTER`) |
| Playbook | Strategy/belief notes → `CHANNEL PLAYBOOK` prompt block (NOT facts) |
| Run dossiers | `vault/<channel>/_runs/` — records of what we made, never read back as facts |
| Link scrape | Yahoo/list items OK; ESPN WAF → use `paste`; Bing search/captcha blocked; `ck/a` unwraps |
| Sports on TapIn | domain from the topic (`infer_topic_domain`); football is TapIn's (`soccer`, §34); NBA/NFL/UFC/soccer matrices; pasted sport facts still override |
| **Headless** | `auto_generate --facts-file <paste-block.txt> --fact "..."` (repeatable) |

## Credit / speed

- **O1–O11 backlog complete** ([credit_efficiency.md](credit_efficiency.md)). `core/quota_governor.py`
  is the single façade over `data/quota_state.json`: Apify exhaustion + usage cache, LLM daily
  spend, persisted signal disables (key-hash invalidated), `snapshot()` for the dashboard.
- Apify 403 = auth (30m TTL), 402 = credits — persists until the real monthly cycle reset
  (`core/reset_window.py`, `APIFY_RESET_DAY`, O10)
- `SIGNAL_BACKEND=apify|free|auto` — `free`/`auto` serve `youtube_competitors` via yt-dlp and
  `reddit` via official OAuth (free script app) at $0; Twitter/TikTok stay Apify
- The claim verifier adds **one extract-tier LLM call per script** (free-first chain, §14);
  `CLAIM_VERIFIER_ENABLED=false` opts out
- Vault reads are **mtime-cached in-process** (`core/vault_index.py`) — no extra cost, big win
  for `batch-drafts` (N ideas × `load_facts` per run)
- `py -m scripts.ops reliability` — dashboard (breakers, budgets, persisted disables, resets, cache)

---

## Best 5 terminal commands (outside `py main.py`)

1. `py -m scripts.ops daily-brief` — morning one-shot: fresh data → ideas → quota → queue
2. `py -m scripts.ops traces` / `ops dossier --run-id N` — run ledger viewers
3. `py -m scripts.ops vault-sync --channel tapin` — beliefs + dossier refresh into vault
4. `py -m scripts.ops batch-drafts --channel tapin --count 3` — unattended draft scripts (feeds A/B)
5. `py -m scripts.ops reliability` — credit/quota/breaker/cache dashboard
6. `py -m scripts.ops feeds` — RSS source health (ok/stale/dead); run monthly, feeds die quietly

Setup path (fresh machine): `py -m scripts.ops all-setup --channel tapin`.

## Open (roadmap next)

The live list is [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) "Recommended next five"; this is the standing context.

1. **Operator:** listen to the next render at 0.95; one debate and one quotes run (#889);
   `ops backfill` to see what history is behind, then `ops backfill all --apply` if it agrees.
2. **Product next (by epic, backlog.md "Epics"):** #849 fact-fit waits on 5+ measured runs (E1)
   · #863 waits on ten runs (E3) · #851 best-bet domain.
3. **Structural:** #914 emoji font off Windows · #459 dead code (operator call) · #927 the gaming count disagreement.
   Any live-run defect: add a corpus case.
4. **App:** #860 facts room shipped wave 46; next Stage 3 panel per [desktop_app.md](desktop_app.md).
5. **Operator calls, standing:** `positioning.md` still pitches a micro-SaaS surface, which
   contradicts the private-tool constraint in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) - the charter is yours
   to rewrite or archive. One OAuth consent then `ops playlists --apply`; gameplay files for
   the empty niches (#786); remote branch deletions this environment cannot do.

**Parked / excluded:** Phase M (Instagram + TikTok) · Benable bot · Edge TTS as default (§28).

- `docs/master_plan.md` — the forward plan, with the sample schedule in M4
- `docs/credit_efficiency.md` — O1–O11 (all ✅)
