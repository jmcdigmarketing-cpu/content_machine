## Last wave — 2026-10-10 (Cursor): #990 #400 #380 #995 #374

`ops log` prints the last lines of `data/logs/content_machine.log` and the warnings in
them, and the Costs page shows the same line (#990). `ops log --limit 15` printed one
warning: YouTube RSS returned 500. Three renders at 2.4 words per second for TapIn's
voice make the spoken rate 2.4; fewer than three stay on 3.3 times the speech speed,
and the length presets still use 3.3 (#400). A billed fact the script uses costs $0.02
per usable fact; no overlap prints "$0.02 and no usable fact"; a free backend is $0.00
(#380). The Apify total is unchanged. With no later run, a vault correction contradicts
"Jon Jones beat Tom Aspinall at UFC 321" and an operator fact confirms the Silksong
sales sentence (#995). A script is two calls by default: premium for the first two
sentences, cheap for the rest. `SCRIPT_BODY_TIER=premium` is the old single call. An
empty hook warns once. A hook response that already contains a script is the package
(#374). This changes the script a healthy run writes. 16 of 17 new tests failed or
errored first. The first full run was 5347 tests and failed the env lint:
`VOICE_PACE_FILE` was not in `.env.example`. It is documented now. mypy 98.
`roadmap-index`: open 310, done 841, numbered open 258, highest #1121.

Next: #1121, #462, #404, #388, #409.

## Previous — 2026-10-10 (Claude Code): waves 75-76, the next ten

Nine shipped, one blocked. A one-chapter video is no longer stored as all-angles (#1115). The
suggest check reports a subject spelled one letter off what people type (#1116). Trace readers
get the run's own title, description and script, so `ops desc-fold` works (#1117). mypy is 98
(#1075). `ops predictions` lists each run's prediction beside its outcome (#1062). Sentences
that are hard to say are flagged and rewritten when no number or name is lost (#1034). A list,
a how-to, a comparison, a look back and a reaction each get their own beats (#1031). A game's
release date is stated against today (#1025, in part). Suite 5330; pushed.

Two items were blocked by what is not there. Click-through: the YouTube Reporting API is not
enabled in the Cloud project - `ops doctor`'s `reach` row says so (#1118; #1058 stays open).
The competitor watch: one competitor on the list and no view counts (#1063; needs #1120).

Filed open: #1119 (patch notes), #1120 (a usable competitor list), #1121 (a YouTube 500 read
as a dead feed). Next: #995, #990, #374, #400, #380.

## Previous — 2026-10-10 (Cursor): Claude's five

The five Claude left. A last-resort chapter title ends on the noun: run 119's
sentence is "The welterweight belt", not "The welterweight belt is the only"
(#1080). UFC 322 is seeded on 2025-11-15, the day ESPN, MSG, and Wikipedia date
it, and 2026-11-14 no longer offers it (#1081). `ops fix-description` replaces
one line of a live description and does not change privacy (#1066). A confirmed
claim is an operator-tier vault fact whose page is the source (#1083). Cost per
published minute counts public videos only, and names the return when revenue
exists (#1072). `ops economics` printed $0.27 over 28.4 minutes, 19 public.

`roadmap-index`: backlog open 320, done 827, numbered open 268, highest open
#1117. Next: #995, #990, #374, #400, #380. #1115 #1116 #1117 are Claude's, in
progress. #1088 stays an operator call.

## Pipeline order (operator)

```
Topic → Discovery (signals + editorial ANGLES) → pick angle → length → KEY FACTS → [fact conflicts] → script → TITLE → grounding → [trade check] → tier warnings → claim verifier → authenticity → [thin facts / event not in facts] → report card → render → [vault dossier]
```

**Titles are NOT chosen at discovery.** Discovery returns short angle lines; `core/title_generator.py` writes the YouTube title after key facts + script + grounding.

**Vault mirror (Pillar 4):** when `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` is set, every drafted/rendered run writes `{channel}/_runs/{run_id}_{slug}.md` (layout: [vault.md](vault.md)); `daily_sync` / `ops vault-sync` refresh dossiers with post-sync actuals. Strategy notes feed a bounded `CHANNEL PLAYBOOK` block in the script prompt (style, not facts).

## Key facts (operator ground truth)

| Feature | Where |
|---------|--------|
| Multi-line paste | Type `paste` at key-facts prompt |
| Vault save (all facts) | typed lines -> `vault/<channel>/_operator_facts/` (`tier: operator`); pasted-link lines -> `_link_facts/` (`tier: link`, since run 98) |
| LLM packing | Char budget 12000 (`OPERATOR_KEY_FACT_CHAR_BUDGET`), line cap 150 (`MAX_OPERATOR_KEY_FACTS`); only lines typed this run pin |
| Priority | typed → links → vault; pasted-link lines with no contact with the angle are listed first (Enter drops, `k` keeps) |
| Conflicts | Operator facts win — contradicting signal/web lines dropped pre-prompt (`FACT_CONFLICT_FILTER`) |
| Playbook | Strategy/belief notes → `CHANNEL PLAYBOOK` prompt block (NOT facts) |
| Run dossiers | `vault/<channel>/_runs/` — records of what we made, never read back as facts |
| Link scrape | Yahoo/list items OK; ESPN WAF → use `paste`; Bing search/captcha blocked; `ck/a` unwraps |
| Sports on TapIn | domain from the topic (`infer_topic_domain`); football is TapIn's (`soccer`, §34); NBA/NFL/UFC/soccer matrices; pasted sport facts still override |
| **Headless** | `auto_generate --facts-file <paste-block.txt> --fact "..."` (repeatable) |

## Credit / speed

- **O1–O11 backlog complete** ([credit_efficiency.md](credit_efficiency.md)). `core/quota_governor.py`
  is the single façade over `data/quota_state.json`: Apify exhaustion + usage cache, LLM daily
  spend, persisted signal disables (key-hash invalidated), `snapshot()` for the dashboard.
- Apify 403 = auth (30m TTL), 402 = credits — persists until the real monthly cycle reset
  (`core/reset_window.py`, `APIFY_RESET_DAY`, O10)
- `SIGNAL_BACKEND=apify|free|auto` — `free`/`auto` serve `youtube_competitors` via yt-dlp and
  `reddit` via official OAuth (free script app) at $0; Twitter/TikTok stay Apify
- The claim verifier adds **one extract-tier LLM call per script** (free-first chain, §14);
  `CLAIM_VERIFIER_ENABLED=false` opts out
- Vault reads are **mtime-cached in-process** (`core/vault_index.py`) — no extra cost, big win
  for `batch-drafts` (N ideas × `load_facts` per run)
- `py -m scripts.ops reliability` — dashboard (breakers, budgets, persisted disables, resets, cache)

---

## Best 5 terminal commands (outside `py main.py`)

1. `py -m scripts.ops daily-brief` — morning one-shot: fresh data → ideas → quota → queue
2. `py -m scripts.ops traces` / `ops dossier --run-id N` — run ledger viewers
3. `py -m scripts.ops vault-sync --channel tapin` — beliefs + dossier refresh into vault
4. `py -m scripts.ops batch-drafts --channel tapin --count 3` — unattended draft scripts (feeds A/B)
5. `py -m scripts.ops reliability` — credit/quota/breaker/cache dashboard
6. `py -m scripts.ops feeds` — RSS source health (ok/stale/dead); run monthly, feeds die quietly

Setup path (fresh machine): `py -m scripts.ops all-setup --channel tapin`.

## Open (roadmap next)

The live list is [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) "Recommended next five"; this is the standing context.

1. **Operator:** `git pull`, `pip install -e ".[app]"`; in ElevenLabs lower Stability (~35-45) and raise Style (~20-30) on the TapIn voices; rerun the Chargers idea (Enter on angle 1), then try "M" on the angle screen; record Madden / UFC 5 gameplay (`ops footage-add`) - stock is now a last resort; confirm runs 119 and 120's claims with `ops verify-claim --run-id N` (run 119's chapter line: Studio by hand), then `go-public`; hand Cursor `docs/cursor_brief_2026-10.md`; `ops spend add` for what was paid; `CONTENT_CHANNEL_ID=tapin` and `youtube.oauth_setup --channel tapin` if not done; Buffer for TikTok and Instagram (#968); the Reporting API (#951); `ops backfill all --apply` if `ops backfill` agrees.
2. **Product next (by epic, backlog.md "Epics"):** #849 fact-fit waits on 5+ measured runs (E1)
   · #863's call prints itself at ten runs (E3).
3. **Structural:** #914 emoji font off Windows · #459 dead code (operator call) · #975 the organic rate on a real boosted video.
   Any live-run defect: add a corpus case.
4. **App:** #860 facts room shipped wave 46; next Stage 3 panel per [desktop_app.md](desktop_app.md).
5. **Operator calls, standing:** `positioning.md` still pitches a micro-SaaS surface, which
   contradicts the private-tool constraint in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) - the charter is yours
   to rewrite or archive. One OAuth consent then `ops playlists --apply`; gameplay files for
   the empty niches (#786); remote branch deletions this environment cannot do.

**Next:** #1121 · #462 · #404 · #388 · #409. #1088 is an operator call. **Oct 24:** the ads decision - does November get one $20 test (`ops promotions`). **Parked / excluded:** Benable bot · Edge TTS as default (§28).
