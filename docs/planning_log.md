# Planning log

A durable record of planning/brainstorming sessions so ideas aren't lost when the
ephemeral plan files (`~/.claude/plans/*.md`) are cleared. **Newest first.** Each entry
captures the prompt, the brainstorm/decisions, and what actually shipped — the tactical
backlog itself lives in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md).

> Convention: when a planning session happens (plan mode, or a substantial "what should we
> build" discussion), append a dated section here with the options considered, the
> decision, and — once built — the outcome. See [../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md).

## 2026-07-22 — Best Bet breadth

**Prompt:** *"best bet needs more options"* — the startup best-bet picker returned too few,
too-similar topics, especially on a single-domain channel (tapin = gaming).

**Findings:** `core/best_bet.py get_best_bets()` drew fresh candidates only from RSS, capped
one pick per domain in Phase 1, applied a per-**anchor** franchise cap in Phase 2, and had
`n=3` hardcoded at `main.py:282` (prompt `[1-3]`). Hard constraint: best-bet runs at
**startup before discovery**, so any new candidate source must be **$0/keyless** and never
trigger paid Apify.

**Decision (operator, asked & answered):** build Best Bet breadth next, then Pillar 7, then
roadmap items — continuing until usage runs out; and **document every planning session in
the repo** (this file).

**Shipped:**
- **Configurable count** — `best_bet_option_count()` (`BEST_BET_OPTIONS`, default 5, clamp
  1–8); `main.py` uses it + a dynamic `[1-N]` prompt.
- **Angle multiplexing** (the core fix) — `_angle_options()` fills leftover slots with
  *distinct angles* on the dominant franchise (tier list / what's broken / meta evolution)
  reusing `_KEYWORD_ANGLE_MAP` + `_FALLBACK_ANGLES`. $0; no filler for no-anchor channels.
- **Opt-in keyless breadth** — `BEST_BET_SIGNALS` (csv, default `rss`) can add keyless
  `reddit` (hot) + `youtube` (view-velocity) candidates via `apis/free_backends`, through
  the same commerce/dedup filter, fail-open, never paid Apify. Off by default (latency).

**Not done (deliberate):** rebalancing configured slot lists; a ranked slot menu.

## 2026-07-22 — Scheduling mechanics

**Prompt:** *"the best times are always on a weekend which makes it useless"* + *"make the
individual just take a time input instead of minutes from now."*

**Findings:** Upload Option 3 (`core/ui.py`) took "minutes from now". The learned post-slot
picker (`analytics/post_timing.learn_slots_from_analytics`) ranked by **summed** engagement,
so the highest-volume day (already weekend-leaning) kept winning — a weekend feedback loop.

**Decision (operator):** fix the learner bias **only** — leave the configured default slots
and Option 4 untouched; the manual time input is the weekday lever.

**Shipped:** `parse_local_time_input()` (clock time / tomorrow / ISO datetime → UTC, in the
channel tz); learner now ranks by **average** engaged-rate per bucket with a min-sample
floor; `free-doctor` distinguishes "Ollama running, set OLLAMA_MODEL" from "no free LLM".
*Caveat surfaced:* learner only overrides once ≥8 timed samples exist.

## 2026-07 — Next-level roadmap assessment (local $0 stack → Best Bet → run-without-PC → Pillar 7)

**Prompt:** a planning-only strategy pass triggered by (1) HuggingFace model buckets
published to the operator's account, (2) real PC specs (Ryzen 7 7800X3D, 32 GB, RTX 4070 Ti
12 GB), (3) *"best bet needs more options"* + *"run without the PC?"*, and (4) a reference to
Microsoft/GitHub **"skill ops"** (Agent Skills + SkillOpt).

**Bucket verdicts:** ★ **Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-CustomVoice** (local $0 voice cloning — WIN);
★ **Bonsai-27B-gguf** (local LLM via Ollama, ends the retired-free-model crash class; vision
unlocks rendered-video review — WIN, use the ternary variant for 12 GB); ◐ mT5 XLSum
(multilingual summariser — maybe, for multi-language); ◐ tabfm (tabular FM — maybe, data-
gated); ✗ MusaCoder-27B / LLaMA-Mesh / Bernini-R (not content-pipeline or won't fit 12 GB).

**Sequenced plan (operator-locked):** (1) **Local $0 stack** — A1 Qwen3-TTS provider
[shipped], A2 Bonsai/Ollama enablement [operator pulls the model]; (2) **Best Bet breadth**
[shipped, see above]; (3) *run-without-PC* (FastAPI panel + Tailscale + two-layer split) —
**parked**, honest reality: the GPU/render/TTS half is PC-bound, cloud/phone Claude Code is a
*dev* surface, not a *run-the-factory* surface; (4) **Pillar 7 — Self-improving skills**:
expose `scripts/ops.py @_register` as `SKILL.md` Agent Skills (C1) + a **SkillOpt-Sleep**
nightly loop in `core/overnight.py` that ships prompt/skill edits only when they beat the
frozen `core/prompt_evals.py` gate (C2) — compounds with the local frozen Bonsai into a
self-improving $0 factory.

**Excluded throughout:** multi-platform distribution (Phase M) stays parked.
