# Planning log

A durable record of planning/brainstorming sessions so ideas aren't lost when the
ephemeral plan files (`~/.claude/plans/*.md`) are cleared. **Newest first.** Each entry
captures the prompt, the brainstorm/decisions, and what actually shipped — the tactical
backlog itself lives in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md).

> Convention: when a planning session happens (plan mode, or a substantial "what should we
> build" discussion), append a dated section here with the options considered, the
> decision, and — once built — the outcome. See [../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md).

## 2026-07-29 — 2026-H2 strategy brainstorm (short/long term, blockers, roadmap refresh)

**Prompt:** *"brainstorm as much as we can with where we are, including updating roadmaps,
long term future, short term future. Reddit api still needs manual setup, multi platform
requires many things and verification… which i don't know if i am eligible for."*

**The core idea (the doc's thesis):** the roadmap contains a contradiction — a large block
of work is **volume-gated** ("don't build until publish volume supports correlations"), but
**Phase O deliberately caps volume** (cadence guardrail + authenticity checks). The learning
loop is rate-limited by our own compliance layer. **Reframe: optimize *information per
publish*, not publishes** — richer per-run instrumentation (Pillar 1), within-publish
structural experiments (the shipped title-pattern A/B generalizes to hook archetype, length,
slot, thumbnail), and **cross-channel pooling** (tapin + moneywise share what's structural).

**Decisions (operator):**
1. **Phase M stays parked entirely** — but the eligibility research is now *recorded* so it
   never needs redoing.
2. **Both futures, sequenced** — near-term quality + reliability so published volume
   compounds; long-term the **intelligence/analyst product line** (already half-built in
   `core/intelligence_report.py`) as the depth play that needs no volume and hedges
   single-platform risk.

**Blockers, verified:**
- **Reddit setup is irreducible** — `apis/free_backends.py` documents that keyless
  reddit JSON is **403-blocked for bots**, so the free script-app OAuth is the only $0 path.
  Fix is **UX not elimination**: an `ops reddit-setup` that prints the click-path, validates
  credentials with a live token call, and shows a clear `free-doctor` line.
- **Multi-platform eligibility concern is well-founded.** TikTok **Upload to Inbox /
  Creator's Draft needs no audit** (human publishes from drafts); **Direct Post** needs a
  2–4 week audit and unaudited Direct Post is **private-only**. Instagram needs a
  Business/Creator account + linked FB Page + app review (dev-mode-with-own-account is
  **unverified**). Both audits are shaped for *interactive multi-tenant apps* — a solo
  headless pipeline doesn't fit that shape. Parked, with the honest revisit order recorded.

**Shipped:** [strategy_2026H2.md](strategy_2026H2.md) (where we are, the volume paradox,
short/medium/long-term horizons, risks & hedges, an explicit **do-not-build** list) +
roadmap refresh (audit-derived correctness items, `ops reddit-setup`, Phase M rewritten with
verified facts). Docs only. Earlier the same day: PRs #26 (LLM strategy), #27 (trade
validation), #28 ([code_audit_2026-07.md](code_audit_2026-07.md)).

## 2026-07-24 — Pillar 7: Self-improving skills (Agent Skills + SkillOpt)

**Prompt:** *"continue pillar 7 and from there advance as scheduled."* Built autonomously
(safe-by-design) rather than pausing for a fresh approval gate.

**How it maps to what already existed:** the `scripts/ops.py` `@_register` registry is a
skill catalog; `core/prompt_evals.py` is a frozen validation gate; `core/overnight.py` is the
nightly runner; the Pillar 4 vault `playbook_block` is the "ship" surface. Pillar 7 just names
and closes those loops.

**Shipped:**
- **C1 — Ops-as-skills** — `core/ops_skills.py` renders `skills/content-ops/SKILL.md` (Agent
  Skills frontmatter + a command table) from the live registry; `ops gen-skills` regenerates
  it so it never drifts from the CLI.
- **C2 — SkillOpt-Sleep** — `core/skillopt.py` scores the live prompts vs curated candidate
  STYLE DIRECTIVEs on the frozen `prompt_evals` rubric across the golden topics (new
  `extra_directive` seam in `content_engine`), keeps only a gate-beater
  (`SKILLOPT_MIN_MARGIN`), and writes a reviewable **proposal** record to the vault +
  `skillopt_proposal` event. Runs in `overnight` when `SKILLOPT_ENABLED=true`.

**Key safety decision:** C2 **never auto-edits live prompts**. It proposes a gate-validated
directive; the operator promotes it to a `[strategy]` playbook bullet. This delivers the full
SkillOpt "validated optimization" value with zero autonomous prompt-mutation risk. Follow-ups
(deferred): LLM-proposed directives; optional auto-apply behind a flag.

## 2026-07-22 — Best Bet breadth

**Prompt:** *"best bet needs more options"* — the startup best-bet picker returned too few,
too-similar topics, especially on a single-domain channel (tapin = gaming).

**Findings:** `core/best_bet.py get_best_bets()` drew fresh candidates only from RSS, capped
one pick per domain in Phase 1, applied a per-**anchor** franchise cap in Phase 2, and had
`n=3` hardcoded at `main.py:282` (prompt `[1-3]`). Hard constraint: best-bet runs at
**startup before discovery**, so any new candidate source must be **$0/keyless** and never
trigger paid Apify.

**Decision (operator, asked & answered):** build Best Bet breadth next, then Pillar 7, then
roadmap items — continuing until usage runs out; and **document every planning session in
the repo** (this file).

**Shipped:**
- **Configurable count** — `best_bet_option_count()` (`BEST_BET_OPTIONS`, default 5, clamp
  1–8); `main.py` uses it + a dynamic `[1-N]` prompt.
- **Angle multiplexing** (the core fix) — `_angle_options()` fills leftover slots with
  *distinct angles* on the dominant franchise (tier list / what's broken / meta evolution)
  reusing `_KEYWORD_ANGLE_MAP` + `_FALLBACK_ANGLES`. $0; no filler for no-anchor channels.
- **Opt-in keyless breadth** — `BEST_BET_SIGNALS` (csv, default `rss`) can add keyless
  `reddit` (hot) + `youtube` (view-velocity) candidates via `apis/free_backends`, through
  the same commerce/dedup filter, fail-open, never paid Apify. Off by default (latency).

**Not done (deliberate):** rebalancing configured slot lists; a ranked slot menu.

## 2026-07-22 — Scheduling mechanics

**Prompt:** *"the best times are always on a weekend which makes it useless"* + *"make the
individual just take a time input instead of minutes from now."*

**Findings:** Upload Option 3 (`core/ui.py`) took "minutes from now". The learned post-slot
picker (`analytics/post_timing.learn_slots_from_analytics`) ranked by **summed** engagement,
so the highest-volume day (already weekend-leaning) kept winning — a weekend feedback loop.

**Decision (operator):** fix the learner bias **only** — leave the configured default slots
and Option 4 untouched; the manual time input is the weekday lever.

**Shipped:** `parse_local_time_input()` (clock time / tomorrow / ISO datetime → UTC, in the
channel tz); learner now ranks by **average** engaged-rate per bucket with a min-sample
floor; `free-doctor` distinguishes "Ollama running, set OLLAMA_MODEL" from "no free LLM".
*Caveat surfaced:* learner only overrides once ≥8 timed samples exist.

## 2026-07 — Next-level roadmap assessment (local $0 stack → Best Bet → run-without-PC → Pillar 7)

**Prompt:** a planning-only strategy pass triggered by (1) HuggingFace model buckets
published to the operator's account, (2) real PC specs (Ryzen 7 7800X3D, 32 GB, RTX 4070 Ti
12 GB), (3) *"best bet needs more options"* + *"run without the PC?"*, and (4) a reference to
Microsoft/GitHub **"skill ops"** (Agent Skills + SkillOpt).

**Bucket verdicts:** ★ **Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-CustomVoice** (local $0 voice cloning — WIN);
★ **Bonsai-27B-gguf** (local LLM via Ollama, ends the retired-free-model crash class; vision
unlocks rendered-video review — WIN, use the ternary variant for 12 GB); ◐ mT5 XLSum
(multilingual summariser — maybe, for multi-language); ◐ tabfm (tabular FM — maybe, data-
gated); ✗ MusaCoder-27B / LLaMA-Mesh / Bernini-R (not content-pipeline or won't fit 12 GB).

**Sequenced plan (operator-locked):** (1) **Local $0 stack** — A1 Qwen3-TTS provider
[shipped], A2 Bonsai/Ollama enablement [operator pulls the model]; (2) **Best Bet breadth**
[shipped, see above]; (3) *run-without-PC* (FastAPI panel + Tailscale + two-layer split) —
**parked**, honest reality: the GPU/render/TTS half is PC-bound, cloud/phone Claude Code is a
*dev* surface, not a *run-the-factory* surface; (4) **Pillar 7 — Self-improving skills**:
expose `scripts/ops.py @_register` as `SKILL.md` Agent Skills (C1) + a **SkillOpt-Sleep**
nightly loop in `core/overnight.py` that ships prompt/skill edits only when they beat the
frozen `core/prompt_evals.py` gate (C2) — compounds with the local frozen Bonsai into a
self-improving $0 factory.

**Excluded throughout:** multi-platform distribution (Phase M) stays parked.
