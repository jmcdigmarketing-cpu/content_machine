# Content OS — roadmap

**What to do now.** The full inventory, the desktop programme, and the history live
in their own files — this one stays short enough to read at the start of every
session.

| file | what it holds |
|---|---|
| **roadmap.md** (this) | the current stage, the next five, track counts |
| [desktop_app.md](desktop_app.md) | the Windows application programme — stages 0–7 |
| [backlog.md](backlog.md) | every open item, numbered 21–670 plus unnumbered |
| [roadmap_archive.md](roadmap_archive.md) | completed waves and historical phases |

Direction: [vision.md](vision.md) · pace and cost: [operating_plan.md](operating_plan.md)
· decisions: [decisions.md](decisions.md) · honest state:
[assessment.md](assessment.md) · session state: [handoff.md](handoff.md) ·
brainstorming: [planning_log.md](planning_log.md).

**This is a private, local, single-operator tool.** Nothing here is published or
shared, which is why several "product" items were retired outright rather than
deferred — see [desktop_app.md](desktop_app.md).

## Now

**Just landed** - 2026-09-09 next-15: tick leftover **#714**, then **#715** CI
concurrency, dead McAfee RSS **#584**, honesty (**#572 #580 #595 #452 #362
#364 #336 #605 #599**), **#437** dry-run rollback, **#713** chroma caption
anchor, **#415** ffmpeg smoke in CI. Projected TTS prints at Proceed?.
`ops free-cost` reads last-run billed cost, not a fresh estimate.

**Previously this day** - next-15 **#710 #712 #431 #549 #414 #420 #498 #711
#708 #562 #569 #568 #430 #440 #705**; **#702-#707 + #709**; **#153** retired
(do not rebuild; **#717** is the face/score remainder of #713).

### Recommended next five (non-app)

All five of the previous list shipped, so this one is built from what the wave
measured. Three of the five are its own findings.

1. **#721 a low horizon still reads as a caption overlay** `[M]` - the one gap
   #717 did not close, and the reason `CAPTION_AUTO_PLACE` is still off. A
   horizon at 65-90% of frame height is a full-width luminance step, same shape
   as a lower-third. The fix is temporal: two frames a second apart, where an
   overlay is pixel-identical and scenery is not. **Closing this is what lets the
   flag default on**, so it outranks new surface.
2. **#722 derive the free-tier dates instead of typing them** `[M]` - #378's
   calendar is honest that its dates are hand-maintained, but a stale `resets` is
   indistinguishable from a correct one. `apify_get_usage` already records the
   Apify side.
3. **#723 the headroom line repeats once per variant** `[S]` - #590 prints from
   `build_registry`, which runs per variant. Emit once per process unless a number
   moved.
4. **#716 CI push+PR group key** `[S]` - still the operator call it was filed as,
   but it is now the cheapest open CI item.
5. **#158 Cost Control Tower** `[L]` - unparked deliberately: #590 and #378 just
   built two of its readings, so the dashboard has real inputs for the first time.

**Dropped from this list** (stay open): **#673** second monitor · Phase M ·
Ollama · the remaining `[L]` desktop panels.

vacuous; #580 ops verb re-estimated instead of reading last-run cost.

stamps that equal-span also produces.

**Closed 2026-09-09 (#702-#707 + #709):** retraction `source_urls` - Postgres
`SKIP LOCKED` - correction-scan throttle - ReviewWindow keys - Qt fixture

**RETIRED 2026-09-09 — #153 caption choreography.** Operator: *"i dont need to
see the caption timing, i dont want to do that manually."* Karaoke ASS hashed
identical with no sidecar. **Do not rebuild the timeline UI.**

**Closed 2026-09-09 (defect + kit wave):** **#701** weekend clock - **#700**

## Tracks

Every open item belongs to exactly one. Counts come from
`py -m scripts.ops roadmap-index`, never from hand-counting.

| track | what it covers |
|---|---|
| `app` | the desktop programme — see [desktop_app.md](desktop_app.md) |
| `engine` | angles, script, facts, grounding, claim verification |
| `video` | render, captions, assets, owned footage |
| `signals` | discovery sources, reliability, breakers, caching |
| `cost` | TTS, Apify, YouTube units, unit economics |
| `publish` | YouTube API, policy, scheduling, disclosure |
| `analytics` | the learning loop and its statistical honesty |
| `ops` | CLI, tests, docs, packaging hygiene |
| `parked` | deliberately not now — Phase M, volume-gated studios |

---

## Still not happening

Phase M multi-platform (TikTok/Reels) stays parked. No SaaS, no web product, no
second operator seat, no standalone fact-engine surface — all retired on the
private/local constraint. The CUDA torch wheel is uninstalled by choice until
Stage 7; `ops doctor` reports `cuda` FAIL by design and it gates nothing.

## Operator checklist

**Fast path:** `py -m scripts.ops all-setup --channel tapin` then `py main.py`

1. `py -m storage.migrate_layout`
2. `py -m storage.migrate_schema` (until Alembic baseline replaces ad-hoc DDL)
3. `py -m analytics.seed_tapin --channel tapin`
4. `py -m config.validate_channels --channel tapin`
5. `py -m youtube.check_setup --channel tapin`
6. Add clips to `video/backgrounds/` for hybrid mode
7. `YOUTUBE_UPLOAD_ENABLED=true` + `py -m jobs.worker --loop 30`

**`py main.py` menu:** 1) new video · 2) queue manager · 3) intelligence report ·
4) sync analytics · 5) make a video from your own idea / a YouTube link

**Recommendation helpers:** `py -m scripts.ops recommend-time --channel tapin` ·
`recommend-length` · best-bet shown at startup

**Developer setup:** `pip install -e ".[dev]"` then `pre-commit install`;
`ruff check .` · `ruff format .` · `mypy analytics apis core config storage`.
Tooling config lives in `pyproject.toml`.
