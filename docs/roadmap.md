# Content OS — roadmap

**What to do now.** The full inventory, the desktop programme, and the history live
in their own files — this one stays short enough to read at the start of every
session.

| file | what it holds |
|---|---|
| **roadmap.md** (this) | the current stage, the next five, track counts |
| [desktop_app.md](desktop_app.md) | the Windows application programme — stages 0–7 |
| [backlog.md](backlog.md) | every open item, numbered 21–670 plus unnumbered |
| [roadmap_archive.md](roadmap_archive.md) | completed waves and historical phases |

Direction: [vision.md](vision.md) · pace and cost: [operating_plan.md](operating_plan.md)
· decisions: [decisions.md](decisions.md) · honest state:
[assessment.md](assessment.md) · session state: [handoff.md](handoff.md) ·
brainstorming: [planning_log.md](planning_log.md).

**This is a private, local, single-operator tool.** Nothing here is published or
shared, which is why several "product" items were retired outright rather than
deferred — see [desktop_app.md](desktop_app.md).

## Now

**Just landed** - 2026-09-18 wave 21: the batch loop ran for real and the first thing it
showed was that it had never worked. **#779** every overnight draft was thrown away (0/3;
fixed, then 3/3 saved - runs 88-90 wait in `ops batch-review`) · nightly drafts **installed**
(05:00, `ContentMachine\OvernightDrafts`) · **#771** the whisper aligner is on (tiny, 68x
realtime) and its timings reach the sidecar · **#780** `ops studio-deleted` says what it
checked - run 77 is still up.

**Previously** - 2026-09-17 wave 20: **#775** long-form paid again after the listen ·
**#776** weekly spend warning · **#770 #773 #774 #777**. Wave 19 **#755 #627 #769 #763 #764
#766 #765 #767 #768 #772**; wave 18 **#760 #762 #761 #345 #756 #749**; **#153** retired
(do not rebuild).

### Recommended next five (non-app)

**Volume framing (2026-09-17):** a long video is 1-2 a month; the 3-5/week target is Shorts.
Three drafts now wait for a review, and a new three arrive each morning at 05:00.

1. **Operator: review runs 88-90** - `py -m scripts.ops batch-review --channel tapin`. Nothing
   below matters until one Short actually uploads.
2. **#781 one YouTube read timeout drops the signal for the whole run** `[S]` - every run this
   week; the same call answers in 0.6 s in isolation.
3. **#601 playlist by franchise** `[M]` - needs a wider OAuth scope (operator re-auth) and a
   playlist per franchise.
4. **#600 re-check monetisation 48h after publish** `[M]` - once Shorts are going out.
5. **#739 captions by footage source** `[M]` - carried; needs the stock segment sampled.

**Dropped from this list** (stay open): **#730** (operator call) · **#728** (no clip) · **#628**
· **#731** · Phase M · Ollama.

## Tracks

Every open item belongs to exactly one. Counts come from
`py -m scripts.ops roadmap-index`, never from hand-counting.

| track | what it covers |
|---|---|
| `app` | the desktop programme — see [desktop_app.md](desktop_app.md) |
| `engine` | angles, script, facts, grounding, claim verification |
| `video` | render, captions, assets, owned footage |
| `signals` | discovery sources, reliability, breakers, caching |
| `cost` | TTS, Apify, YouTube units, unit economics |
| `publish` | YouTube API, policy, scheduling, disclosure |
| `analytics` | the learning loop and its statistical honesty |
| `ops` | CLI, tests, docs, packaging hygiene |
| `parked` | deliberately not now — Phase M, volume-gated studios |

---

## Still not happening

Phase M multi-platform (TikTok/Reels) stays parked. No SaaS, no web product, no
second operator seat, no standalone fact-engine surface — all retired on the
private/local constraint. The CUDA torch wheel is uninstalled by choice until
Stage 7; `ops doctor` reports `cuda` FAIL by design and it gates nothing.

---

## Operator checklist

**Fast path:** `py -m scripts.ops all-setup --channel tapin` then `py main.py`

1. `py -m storage.migrate_layout`
2. `py -m storage.migrate_schema` (until Alembic baseline replaces ad-hoc DDL)
3. `py -m analytics.seed_tapin --channel tapin`
4. `py -m config.validate_channels --channel tapin`
5. `py -m youtube.check_setup --channel tapin`
6. Add clips to `video/backgrounds/` for hybrid mode
7. `YOUTUBE_UPLOAD_ENABLED=true` + `py -m jobs.worker --loop 30`

**`py main.py` menu:** 1) new video · 2) queue manager · 3) intelligence report ·
4) sync analytics · 5) make a video from your own idea / a YouTube link

**Recommendation helpers:** `py -m scripts.ops recommend-time --channel tapin` ·
`recommend-length` · best-bet shown at startup

**Developer setup:** `pip install -e ".[dev]"` then `pre-commit install`;
`ruff check .` · `ruff format .` · `mypy analytics apis core config storage`.
Tooling config lives in `pyproject.toml`.
