# Content OS — roadmap

> **Class:** plan · **Status:** living · **Reviewed:** 2026-09-27

**What to do now.** The full inventory, the desktop programme, and the history live
in their own files — this one stays short enough to read at the start of every
session.

| file | what it holds |
|---|---|
| **roadmap.md** (this) | the current stage, the next five, track counts |
| [desktop_app.md](desktop_app.md) | the Windows application programme — stages 0–7 |
| [backlog.md](backlog.md) | every open item, numbered from 21 to the highest `ops roadmap-index` reports, plus unnumbered |
| [roadmap_archive.md](roadmap_archive.md) | completed waves and historical phases |

Direction: [vision.md](vision.md) · pace and cost: [operating_plan.md](operating_plan.md)
· decisions: [decisions.md](decisions.md) · honest state:
[assessment.md](assessment.md) · session state: [handoff.md](handoff.md) ·
brainstorming: [planning_log.md](planning_log.md).

**This is a private, local, single-operator tool.** Nothing here is published or
shared, which is why several "product" items were retired outright rather than
deferred — see [desktop_app.md](desktop_app.md).

## Now

**Just landed** - 2026-09-27 wave 40: **#890** the voice speaks a touch slower (0.95; `TTS_SPEED`
or `tts.speed` per channel) · **#891** "it's not just X - it's Y" is found as a pattern and
restated · **#879** a continuation keeps its series name · **#876** game names learned from
confirmed runs (`ops game-names`) · **#870** one `ops backfill` over a registry · **#855** the
dead `INGEST_ENABLED` removed, and every documented setting now needs a reader · **#849**
fact-fit is measured and stored (selection unchanged until it has an n).

**Before that** - wave 39: **#883-#886** more than one voice, **#877 #878** · wave 38: **#865
#873 #875 #856 #867 #869** · wave 37: **#872 #866 #874**. Earlier:
[roadmap_archive.md](roadmap_archive.md) and [planning_log.md](planning_log.md).

### Recommended next five (non-app)

**Wave 40 (2026-09-27)** cleared four of the five and put #849 on a measurement. The list
changed: #849 and #863 wait on runs, not code; #888 and two items found this wave join.

1. **#888 the dossier after the render** `[S]` - voices, speed and render hashes appear
   only after the overnight rewrite.
2. **#892 the suite writes five `data/` files** `[S]` - redirect them and guard it.
3. **#893 pre-render chapter times at the new pace** `[S]` - scale by `speech_speed`.
4. **#832 `apis/scrapers` missing from the wheel** `[S]`.
5. **#831 the ruff bump** `[M]` - its own wave-sized commit series.

**Waiting on runs:** #849 fact-fit needs 5+ measured runs carrying it; #863 needs ten.

**Waiting on the operator, not on code:** listen to the next render (about 5% slower;
`TTS_SPEED=1.0` undoes it), one debate and one quotes run (#889), then `ops backfill` to see what
history is behind. Structural queue: #834.

**Still the operator's, unchanged:** review the 05:00 drafts (`ops batch-review`); one OAuth
consent then `ops playlists --apply`; gameplay files for the empty niches (#786). After the first
live TTS run, check that `ops reliability` reports TTS-cache hits rather than `0/3`.
`ARTIFACT_RETENTION_APPLY` stays unset unless you want overnight to delete.

**Dropped from this list** (stay open): **#730** (operator call) · **#728** (no clip) ·
**#628** · **#731** · Phase M · Ollama. **#739 is closed, not dropped** - measured and rejected.

**Closed 2026-09-20 (wave 30):** **#817 #818 #822 #739 #823**. Filed open: **#824 #825 #826**.
Two items closed *without* a behaviour change because the measurement said not to (#822, #739);
#817 closed because its filed text was wrong. `ops backfill-quality` applied on the operator's
call - 87 rows, and backfilled grades are stamped so calibration cannot read them as evidence
the rubric held.

**Closed 2026-09-20 (wave 29):** **#808 #805 #561 #803 #811**, plus wave 28's **#813 #814 #815
#816**. `QUALITY_VERSION` v3 -> v4; **`GRADE_VERSION` unchanged at v4**. `DISCOVERY_DEADLINE_S`
unset by default. Style recurrence report-only (#821).

**Closed 2026-09-20 (wave 27):** **#806 #807 #810 #812 #802**. igdb/steam 1/33 is a documented
known gap, not a §19 zero. Hedge density remains grade-only. Authenticity gate stays binary.
Overnight stays render-free. Retention apply stays off unless the env is set.

**Closed 2026-09-20 (wave 26):** **#799 #800 #801 #809 #804**. `GRADE_VERSION` v3 → v4.

**Filed 2026-09-20 (wave 25, documentation):** **#799 #800 #801 #802 #803** (script) - **#804
#805 #806 #807 #808** (grading) - **#809 #810 #811 #812** (resources).

**Closed 2026-09-19 (wave 24):** **#792 #793 #795 #796 #797 #798**. Narrowed **#788**.

**Closed 2026-09-19 (wave 23):** **#785 #787 #600 #789 #790 #791**. Narrowed **#786**; filed open **#788**.

#364 #336 #605 #599 #437 #713 #415**. Found: #715 comment-out guard was
vacuous; #580 ops verb re-estimated instead of reading last-run cost.

#708 #562 #569 #568 #430 #440 #705**. Found: the extras chapter test used
stamps that equal-span also produces.

**Closed 2026-09-09 (#702-#707 + #709):** retraction `source_urls` - Postgres
`SKIP LOCKED` - correction-scan throttle - ReviewWindow keys - Qt fixture
decode - jsonb cast for Text `payload_json`.

**RETIRED 2026-09-09 — #153 caption choreography.** Operator: *"i dont need to
see the caption timing, i dont want to do that manually."* Karaoke ASS hashed
identical with no sidecar. **Do not rebuild the timeline UI.**

**Closed 2026-09-09 (defect + kit wave):** **#701** weekend clock - **#700**

## Tracks

Every open item belongs to exactly one. Counts come from
`py -m scripts.ops roadmap-index`, never from hand-counting.

| track | what it covers |
|---|---|
| `app` | the desktop programme — see [desktop_app.md](desktop_app.md) |
| `engine` | angles, script, facts, grounding, claim verification |
| `video` | render, captions, assets, owned footage |
| `signals` | discovery sources, reliability, breakers, caching |
| `cost` | TTS, Apify, YouTube units, unit economics |
| `publish` | YouTube API, policy, scheduling, disclosure |
| `analytics` | the learning loop and its statistical honesty |
| `ops` | CLI, tests, docs, packaging hygiene |
| `parked` | deliberately not now — Phase M, volume-gated studios |

---

## Still not happening

Phase M multi-platform (TikTok/Reels) stays parked. No SaaS, no web product, no
second operator seat, no standalone fact-engine surface — all retired on the
private/local constraint. The CUDA torch wheel is uninstalled by choice until
Stage 7; `ops doctor` reports `cuda` FAIL by design and it gates nothing.

---

## Operator checklist

**Fast path:** `py -m scripts.ops all-setup --channel tapin` then `py main.py`

1. `py -m storage.migrate_layout`
2. `py -m storage.migrate_schema` (until Alembic baseline replaces ad-hoc DDL)
3. `py -m analytics.seed_tapin --channel tapin`
4. `py -m config.validate_channels --channel tapin`
5. `py -m youtube.check_setup --channel tapin`
6. Add clips to `video/backgrounds/` for hybrid mode
7. `YOUTUBE_UPLOAD_ENABLED=true` + `py -m jobs.worker --loop 30`

**`py main.py` menu:** 1) new video · 2) queue manager · 3) intelligence report ·
4) sync analytics · 5) make a video from your own idea / a YouTube link

**Recommendation helpers:** `py -m scripts.ops recommend-time --channel tapin` ·
`recommend-length` · best-bet shown at startup

**Developer setup:** `pip install -e ".[dev]"` and `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`
(not `pre-commit install` — the repo's hooks live in `.githooks`); `ruff check .` ·
`ruff format .` · `py scripts/mypy_ratchet.py` · `py -m scripts.ops test --order reverse`.
Tooling config lives in `pyproject.toml`.
