# Content OS — roadmap

> **Class:** plan · **Status:** living · **Reviewed:** 2026-10-10

**What to do now.** The full inventory, the desktop programme, and the history live
in their own files — this one stays short enough to read at the start of every
session.

| file | what it holds |
|---|---|
| **roadmap.md** (this) | the current stage, the next five, track counts |
| [desktop_app.md](desktop_app.md) | the Windows application programme — stages 0–7 |
| [backlog.md](backlog.md) | every open item, numbered from 21 to the highest `ops roadmap-index` reports, plus unnumbered |
| [roadmap_archive.md](roadmap_archive.md) | completed waves and historical phases |

Direction: [vision.md](vision.md) · pace and cost: [operating_plan.md](operating_plan.md)
· decisions: [decisions.md](decisions.md) · honest state:
[assessment.md](assessment.md) · session state: [handoff.md](handoff.md) ·
brainstorming: [planning_log.md](planning_log.md).

**This is a private, local, single-operator tool.** Nothing here is published or
shared, which is why several "product" items were retired outright rather than
deferred — see [desktop_app.md](desktop_app.md).

## Now

**Just landed** - 2026-10-09 wave 66, built so the operator's run 124 idea ("How the 0-4 chargers
can turn it around this year") runs as intended: **#1016** your idea stays yours (angle 1 is your
idea worded for search, Enter keeps it, no take pushed onto it); **#1001 #1002 #1005 #1004** the
subject read right; **#1003** NFL records and next games from ESPN; **#1012 #1017** pasted junk and
unrelated vault facts kept out; **#1018** hooks on solid ground; riders **#1000** (a flagged render
never goes public at its slot), **#1019** CC BY credits, **#1020** stock only as a last resort, voice
speed 1.05. The next 100: [optimization_plan_2026-10.md](optimization_plan_2026-10.md); Cursor's run:
[cursor_brief_2026-10.md](cursor_brief_2026-10.md).

**Before that** - wave 65: **#996 #992 #998 #997 #994** · wave 64: **#988 #987 #959 #989 #977** ·
wave 63: **#985 #986 #984 #978 #979** · wave 62: **#980 #981 #982 #983 #976**. Earlier:
[roadmap_archive.md](roadmap_archive.md) and [planning_log.md](planning_log.md).

### The five weaknesses - where each stands (2026-10-03, after wave 53)

The operator's list from [assessment.md](assessment.md). Every row has shipped its main fix; what
is left is below.

| weakness | shipped | still open |
|---|---|---|
| 1 recency | key facts + vault, claim verifier + title check, grounding gate, thin-facts stop, "no champion from memory", future-date drop, single-source flag, auto-research, **#895** guard, **#899** event research, **#558** past-event previews retire, **#589** second provider on an empty answer, **#860** facts room + **#548** confidence per fact, **#910** links read at once, **#911** confidence in the dossier, **#342** corrections lower a source's weight, **#917** conflicts name the section that lost, **#551** elapsed-time arithmetic (**#978** titles and descriptions too), **#339** unconfirmed mode, **#977** checked against later runs, **#1003** NFL from ESPN, **#1004** news searches the subject, **#1002** lowercase teams, **#1012** pasted junk out, **#1017** uncertain vault facts must name the subject | **#1011** a stale signal record · **#1022** every league + injuries · **#1024** stale best bets |
| 2 API fragility | fail-visible handlers, breakers + quota governor, `ops reliability`, nightly signal canary, seven dead signals retired (**#854**), discovery deadline + cancel, **#385** + **#906** all 18 JSON signals pinned, **#626** contract tests, **#905** `ops record-payloads`, **#908** incidents say why, **#386** `ops replay` from saved signals, **#575** + **#588** `ops signal-audit`, **#921** no network in the suite, **#585** usefulness at discovery, **#574** skips you approve, **#591** seconds per signal, **#586** `ops signal-diff`, **#930** the suite never reads your keys | record real payloads on the PC (operator) |
| 3 relevance | RAWG current-era + relevance, Twitch/fan-out hygiene, domain from the topic, **#896** sports teams, **#897** odds, **#931** a lowercase overview seeds on known names, **#946** athlete names read as their sport, **#1005** no who's-who for common words, **#1016** your idea stays yours, **#1008** stale angles dropped before the menu, **#1014** angles scored without a per-angle fetch, **#1084** your stance kept - neutral by default, a take only when asked | **#1090-#1094** your idea heard once and kept · **#1089** stance beyond the lexicon · **#1007** award races · **#1006** video games read as gaming |
| 4 visuals | word-timed karaoke, auto-placed, ~2.5 s cuts from owned gameplay, clip bands, multi-voice, **#506** second-voice colour, **#411** ducked music bed, **#503** entrance (TapIn pop, MoneyWise fade), **#504** emoji drawn from an emoji font, **#955** footage matches the topic or stays out, **#1020** stock only as a last resort, **#1019** CC BY credits | thumbnails **#1047**, the voice **#1035**, licensed footage **#1040** (Cursor) · #786 your footage (operator) |
| 5 volume | sample counts, 95% intervals, confidence tags, recency weighting, shrinkage in all three recommenders (**#352**), **#559** prediction frozen at publish, **#113** `ops predictions`, **#357** `ops feature-report`, **#909** + **#913** every best-bet pick scored, **#915** scheduled videos counted, **#916** + **#912** the used slot scored and an off-slot test, **#560** forward-only error bars, **#563** time to 100 views, **#918** young videos synced, **#564** views floor, **#598** scheduled vs immediate, **#919** an experiment per kind, **#920** one labelled measure, **#566** title lift, **#428** tag lift, **#565** retention diff, **#579** cost vs return, **#567** a randomised publish hour, **#570** `ops analytics-diff`, **#927** seeded history deduped and out of post time, **#929** every measured run counts, **#934** a views goal and its pace, **#935** your verdicts against the views, **#938** the recommenders aim at 7-day views, **#940** comparable views per video, **#954** organic only - ads out of every number, **#951** stayed / feed share and CTR, **#957** organic engaged rate, **#49** first-day alert, **#945** views prediction, **#985** which openers held viewers, **#988** the intro measured, **#959** what each ad campaign bought, **#992** paid subscribers, **#998** after the ads | #975 the organic rate on a real boosted video · more measured videos |

### Recommended next five (non-app)

**Wave 68 (2026-10-10)** answered run 125 (a hope idea came back as five takes against it): your
stance is kept and a topic with no stance is neutral analysis - a take only when asked by name. The
operator then asked what else could go wrong between the topic and the angles; a read of 6b5f648
found four more ways (planning_log 2026-10-10), two of them from wave 68's own neutral default. They
come first - the most repeated complaint on record (runs 73, 77, 113, 124, 125). **Wave 69, "your
idea, heard once and kept":**

1. **#1094 the intent eval table** `[S]` - every idea you have typed, pinned to how it must read.
2. **#1090 your own take is argued, not countered** `[S]` - "Jets are doomed" lost its agreeing angle.
3. **#1093 the stance kept to the last pass** `[S]` - the hook, the title, the Long close, the check.
4. **#1091 one intent per run, recorded as used** `[M]` - read nine times, recorded from the wrong text.
5. **#1092 change the mode on the angle screen** `[M]` - promised in the code, never built.

Then wave 70: **#1089** stance beyond the lexicon · **#1007** award races · **#1095** research that
serves the stance · **#1006** games read as gaming · **#1021** angle-pick learning, with **#1088**
asked of the operator; after that **#1011 #1060 #1024 #1022 #1082**. Cursor runs phase A meanwhile
(**#1040 #1041 #1047 #1048 #1035 #1036 #1053 #1044**). Wave 69's visible item: "M = change mode".

Parked for an operator call: **#459** dead-code sweep (it would remove reddit's free backend).
**#914** (an emoji font off Windows) waits on whether renders ever leave the PC.

**Waiting on runs:** #849 fact-fit needs 5+ measured runs carrying it; #863's call prints itself at ten; #963-#965
(does a settled topic still get a paste?) needs ten runs in `ops auto-research`.

**Waiting on the operator, not on code:** the back-home tick-list (an artifact page Claude reads
back): git pull and `pip install -e ".[app]"`; in ElevenLabs lower Stability (~35-45) and raise
Style (~20-30) on the TapIn voices; `ops spend add` for what was paid; record 20-30 min of Madden /
UFC 5 gameplay (`ops footage-add`) - with stock a last resort it is what fills a video; confirm run
120's claim and run 119's with `ops verify-claim` (run 119's chapter line is fixed in Studio by hand),
then `go-public`; rerun the Chargers idea and press Enter on angle 1; hand
Cursor [cursor_brief_2026-10.md](cursor_brief_2026-10.md); read `ops promotions` on Oct 24.

**Still the operator's, unchanged:** review the 05:00 drafts (`ops batch-review`); one OAuth
consent then `ops playlists --apply`; gameplay files for the empty niches (#786). After the first
live TTS run, check that `ops reliability` reports TTS-cache hits rather than `0/3`.
`ARTIFACT_RETENTION_APPLY` stays unset unless you want overnight to delete.

**Dropped from this list** (stay open): **#730** (operator call) · **#728** (no clip) ·
**#628** · **#731** · #952's direct APIs (Buffer instead) · Ollama. **#739 is closed, not dropped** - measured and rejected.

**Closed 2026-09-20 (wave 30):** **#817 #818 #822 #739 #823**. Filed open: **#824 #825 #826**.
Two items closed *without* a behaviour change because the measurement said not to (#822, #739);
#817 closed because its filed text was wrong. `ops backfill-quality` applied on the operator's
call - 87 rows, and backfilled grades are stamped so calibration cannot read them as evidence
the rubric held.

**Closed 2026-09-20 (wave 29):** **#808 #805 #561 #803 #811**, plus wave 28's **#813 #814 #815
#816**. `QUALITY_VERSION` v3 -> v4; **`GRADE_VERSION` unchanged at v4**. `DISCOVERY_DEADLINE_S`
unset by default. Style recurrence report-only (#821).

**Closed 2026-09-20 (wave 27):** **#806 #807 #810 #812 #802**. igdb/steam 1/33 is a documented
known gap, not a §19 zero. Hedge density remains grade-only. Authenticity gate stays binary.
Overnight stays render-free. Retention apply stays off unless the env is set.

**Closed 2026-09-20 (wave 26):** **#799 #800 #801 #809 #804**. `GRADE_VERSION` v3 → v4.

**Closed 2026-09-19 (wave 24):** **#792 #793 #795 #796 #797 #798**. Narrowed **#788**.

**Closed 2026-09-19 (wave 23):** **#785 #787 #600 #789 #790 #791**. Narrowed **#786**; filed open **#788**.

## Tracks

Every open item belongs to exactly one. Counts come from
`py -m scripts.ops roadmap-index`, never from hand-counting.

| track | what it covers |
|---|---|
| `app` | the desktop programme — see [desktop_app.md](desktop_app.md) |
| `engine` | angles, script, facts, grounding, claim verification |
| `video` | render, captions, assets, owned footage |
| `signals` | discovery sources, reliability, breakers, caching |
| `cost` | TTS, Apify, YouTube units, unit economics |
| `publish` | YouTube API, policy, scheduling, disclosure |
| `analytics` | the learning loop and its statistical honesty |
| `ops` | CLI, tests, docs, packaging hygiene |
| `parked` | deliberately not now — direct TikTok/Instagram APIs (Buffer instead), volume-gated studios |

---

## Still not happening

Direct TikTok/Instagram publishing APIs stay parked - Phase M goes through Buffer (#968). No SaaS, no web product, no
second operator seat, no standalone fact-engine surface — all retired on the
private/local constraint. The CUDA torch wheel is uninstalled by choice until
Stage 7; `ops doctor` reports `cuda` FAIL by design and it gates nothing.

---

## Operator checklist

**Fast path:** `py -m scripts.ops all-setup --channel tapin` then `py main.py`

1. `py -m storage.migrate_layout`
2. `py -m storage.migrate_schema` (until Alembic baseline replaces ad-hoc DDL)
3. `py -m analytics.seed_tapin --channel tapin`
4. `py -m config.validate_channels --channel tapin`
5. `py -m youtube.check_setup --channel tapin`
6. Add clips to `video/backgrounds/` for hybrid mode
7. `YOUTUBE_UPLOAD_ENABLED=true` + `py -m jobs.worker --loop 30`

**`py main.py` menu:** 1) new video · 2) queue manager · 3) intelligence report ·
4) sync analytics · 5) make a video from your own idea / a YouTube link

**Recommendation helpers:** `py -m scripts.ops recommend-time --channel tapin` ·
`recommend-length` · best-bet shown at startup

**Developer setup:** `pip install -e ".[dev]"` and `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`
(not `pre-commit install` — the repo's hooks live in `.githooks`); `ruff check .` ·
`ruff format .` · `py scripts/mypy_ratchet.py` · `py -m scripts.ops test --order reverse`.
Tooling config lives in `pyproject.toml`.

**Troubleshooting:** [debugging.md](debugging.md)
