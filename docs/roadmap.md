# Content OS — roadmap

> **Class:** plan · **Status:** living · **Reviewed:** 2026-09-30

**What to do now.** The full inventory, the desktop programme, and the history live
in their own files — this one stays short enough to read at the start of every
session.

| file | what it holds |
|---|---|
| **roadmap.md** (this) | the current stage, the next five, track counts |
| [desktop_app.md](desktop_app.md) | the Windows application programme — stages 0–7 |
| [backlog.md](backlog.md) | every open item, numbered from 21 to the highest `ops roadmap-index` reports, plus unnumbered |
| [roadmap_archive.md](roadmap_archive.md) | completed waves and historical phases |

Direction: [vision.md](vision.md) · pace and cost: [operating_plan.md](operating_plan.md)
· decisions: [decisions.md](decisions.md) · honest state:
[assessment.md](assessment.md) · session state: [handoff.md](handoff.md) ·
brainstorming: [planning_log.md](planning_log.md).

**This is a private, local, single-operator tool.** Nothing here is published or
shared, which is why several "product" items were retired outright rather than
deferred — see [desktop_app.md](desktop_app.md).

## Now

**Just landed** - 2026-09-30 wave 50: **#920** every outcome says which measure it holds and
likes/views stops counting · **#566** title patterns ranked by lift over the channel · **#428**
`ops tag-report` · **#565** `ops retention-diff` · **#578** cost per finished minute.

**Before that** - wave 49: **#918 #598 #564 #919 #917** · wave 48: **#915 #913 #916 #912 #560 #563
#342** · wave 47: **#910 #911 #909 #504 #386** · wave 46: **#907 #908 #906 #905 #589 #559 #113 #357
#548 #860**. Earlier: [roadmap_archive.md](roadmap_archive.md) and [planning_log.md](planning_log.md).

### The five weaknesses - where each stands (2026-09-30, after wave 50)

The operator's list from [assessment.md](assessment.md). Every row has shipped its main fix; what
is left is below.

| weakness | shipped | still open |
|---|---|---|
| 1 recency | key facts + vault, claim verifier + title check, grounding gate, thin-facts stop, "no champion from memory", future-date drop, single-source flag, auto-research, **#895** guard, **#899** event research, **#558** past-event previews retire, **#589** second provider on an empty answer, **#860** facts room + **#548** confidence per fact, **#910** links read at once, **#911** confidence in the dossier, **#342** corrections lower a source's weight, **#917** conflicts name the section that lost | - |
| 2 API fragility | fail-visible handlers, breakers + quota governor, `ops reliability`, nightly signal canary, seven dead signals retired (**#854**), discovery deadline + cancel, **#385** + **#906** all 18 JSON signals pinned, **#626** contract tests, **#905** `ops record-payloads`, **#908** incidents say why, **#386** `ops replay` from saved signals | record real payloads on the PC (operator) |
| 3 relevance | RAWG current-era + relevance, Twitch/fan-out hygiene, domain from the topic, **#896** sports teams, **#897** odds | - |
| 4 visuals | word-timed karaoke, auto-placed, ~2.5 s cuts from owned gameplay, clip bands, multi-voice, **#506** second-voice colour, **#411** ducked music bed, **#503** entrance (TapIn pop, MoneyWise fade), **#504** emoji drawn from an emoji font | #914 an emoji font off Windows · #786 footage and your music tracks (operator) |
| 5 volume | sample counts, 95% intervals, confidence tags, recency weighting, shrinkage in all three recommenders (**#352**), **#559** prediction frozen at publish, **#113** `ops predictions`, **#357** `ops feature-report`, **#909** + **#913** every best-bet pick scored, **#915** scheduled videos counted, **#916** + **#912** the used slot scored and an off-slot test, **#560** forward-only error bars, **#563** time to 100 views, **#918** young videos synced, **#564** views floor, **#598** scheduled vs immediate, **#919** an experiment per kind, **#920** one labelled measure, **#566** title lift, **#428** tag lift, **#565** retention diff | #579 cost vs RPM · #567 random publish hour · more measured videos |

### Recommended next five (non-app)

**Wave 50 (2026-09-30)** shipped all five (#920 #566 #565 #428 #578). The next five turn to
cost and the signals themselves, plus one test-hygiene item CI forced:

1. **#921 probe the suite for real network requests** `[S]` - wave 49's CI failure, finished.
2. **#579 warn when a run costs more than the channel's RPM returns** (weakness 5) `[M]` - #578's minute cost makes it computable.
3. **#575 measure which signals actually contribute facts** (weakness 2) `[M]` - and retire the rest.
4. **#588 detect a signal returning identical payloads every time** (weakness 2) `[M]` - a frozen cache reads as healthy.
5. **#567 a publish-hour test that actually randomises** (weakness 5) `[M]` - #912's arm is round-robin.

Parked for an operator call: **#459** dead-code sweep (it would remove reddit's free backend).
**#914** (an emoji font off Windows) waits on whether renders ever leave the PC.

**Waiting on runs:** #849 fact-fit needs 5+ measured runs carrying it; #863 needs ten.

**Waiting on the operator, not on code:** `ops sync-metrics` then `ops predictions` - scheduled videos now sync and count (#915); `ops backfill view-curve --apply` for past videos' time to 100 views (#563); `py -m core.experiments start post_time` only if you want the off-slot test (#912); `ops source-trust` (#342); `ops weekly-report` for scheduled vs immediate (#598); `ops tag-report`, `ops title-patterns`, `ops retention-diff` (#428 #566 #565); `ops predictions` names how many videos sit under 50 views - set `MIN_OUTCOME_VIEWS=50` only if that looks right (#564). Render one video whose script has an emoji to see it drawn (#504); after your next run, `ops replay <run>` (#386) and `ops predictions` (the best-bet row, #909). `ops record-payloads` then `--apply` if the diff looks right (#905, real API shapes into the tests); on the next run in `py -m desktop`, use the facts room and time the key-facts step against run 98's 7.9 min (#860); `ops incidents` after a few runs says what YouTube's "unavailable" is (#908). Render one video per channel to see the caption entrance (#503; `"entrance": "none"` in `caption_skin` turns it off) and run `ops vault-decay` to see which preview lines stopped being used (#558). Drop royalty-free tracks into `assets/music/tapin/` and
`assets/music/moneywise/` (#411), then render one debate video to hear the bed and see the second
colour (#900); on a just-happened topic, watch what the key-facts prompt finds (#899). `ops vault-retier` to see which old notes hold scraped
lines, then `--apply` if the list is right (#857); the next run on a just-happened event should stop
before TTS unless facts are pasted - say if it stops a run it should not (#895). Listen to the next
render (about 5% slower; `TTS_SPEED=1.0` undoes it), one debate and one quotes run (#889), then
`ops backfill` to see what history is behind.

**Still the operator's, unchanged:** review the 05:00 drafts (`ops batch-review`); one OAuth
consent then `ops playlists --apply`; gameplay files for the empty niches (#786). After the first
live TTS run, check that `ops reliability` reports TTS-cache hits rather than `0/3`.
`ARTIFACT_RETENTION_APPLY` stays unset unless you want overnight to delete.

**Dropped from this list** (stay open): **#730** (operator call) · **#728** (no clip) ·
**#628** · **#731** · Phase M · Ollama. **#739 is closed, not dropped** - measured and rejected.

**Closed 2026-09-20 (wave 30):** **#817 #818 #822 #739 #823**. Filed open: **#824 #825 #826**.
Two items closed *without* a behaviour change because the measurement said not to (#822, #739);
#817 closed because its filed text was wrong. `ops backfill-quality` applied on the operator's
call - 87 rows, and backfilled grades are stamped so calibration cannot read them as evidence
the rubric held.

**Closed 2026-09-20 (wave 29):** **#808 #805 #561 #803 #811**, plus wave 28's **#813 #814 #815
#816**. `QUALITY_VERSION` v3 -> v4; **`GRADE_VERSION` unchanged at v4**. `DISCOVERY_DEADLINE_S`
unset by default. Style recurrence report-only (#821).

**Closed 2026-09-20 (wave 27):** **#806 #807 #810 #812 #802**. igdb/steam 1/33 is a documented
known gap, not a §19 zero. Hedge density remains grade-only. Authenticity gate stays binary.
Overnight stays render-free. Retention apply stays off unless the env is set.

**Closed 2026-09-20 (wave 26):** **#799 #800 #801 #809 #804**. `GRADE_VERSION` v3 → v4.

## Tracks

Every open item belongs to exactly one. Counts come from
`py -m scripts.ops roadmap-index`, never from hand-counting.

| track | what it covers |
|---|---|
| `app` | the desktop programme — see [desktop_app.md](desktop_app.md) |
| `engine` | angles, script, facts, grounding, claim verification |
| `video` | render, captions, assets, owned footage |
| `signals` | discovery sources, reliability, breakers, caching |
| `cost` | TTS, Apify, YouTube units, unit economics |
| `publish` | YouTube API, policy, scheduling, disclosure |
| `analytics` | the learning loop and its statistical honesty |
| `ops` | CLI, tests, docs, packaging hygiene |
| `parked` | deliberately not now — Phase M, volume-gated studios |

---

## Still not happening

Phase M multi-platform (TikTok/Reels) stays parked. No SaaS, no web product, no
second operator seat, no standalone fact-engine surface — all retired on the
private/local constraint. The CUDA torch wheel is uninstalled by choice until
Stage 7; `ops doctor` reports `cuda` FAIL by design and it gates nothing.

---

## Operator checklist

**Fast path:** `py -m scripts.ops all-setup --channel tapin` then `py main.py`

1. `py -m storage.migrate_layout`
2. `py -m storage.migrate_schema` (until Alembic baseline replaces ad-hoc DDL)
3. `py -m analytics.seed_tapin --channel tapin`
4. `py -m config.validate_channels --channel tapin`
5. `py -m youtube.check_setup --channel tapin`
6. Add clips to `video/backgrounds/` for hybrid mode
7. `YOUTUBE_UPLOAD_ENABLED=true` + `py -m jobs.worker --loop 30`

**`py main.py` menu:** 1) new video · 2) queue manager · 3) intelligence report ·
4) sync analytics · 5) make a video from your own idea / a YouTube link

**Recommendation helpers:** `py -m scripts.ops recommend-time --channel tapin` ·
`recommend-length` · best-bet shown at startup

**Developer setup:** `pip install -e ".[dev]"` and `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`
(not `pre-commit install` — the repo's hooks live in `.githooks`); `ruff check .` ·
`ruff format .` · `py scripts/mypy_ratchet.py` · `py -m scripts.ops test --order reverse`.
Tooling config lives in `pyproject.toml`.

**Troubleshooting:** [debugging.md](debugging.md)
